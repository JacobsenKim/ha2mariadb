# 🗃️ Homeassistant Sqlite3 to mariaDB merger

☑️  ha2mariadb

☑️   2024-04-17 - Update to work with the new schema version 43.

# 💡This need to wipe all data in HA mariaDB to work💡

💡 So if you have run homeassistant on mariaDB for some time and want to merge an old HA sqlight3 DB and at the same time keep the data you have in mariadb, this wont work.
