# 🗃️ Homeassistant Sqlite3 to mariaDB migration

☑️  ha2mariadb

☑️   2025-07-17 - Update to work with the new schema for core 2025.7.2.
☑️   2024-04-17 - Update to work with the new schema version 43.

# 💡The target mariaDB should be empty for the migration to work.

If you have run homeassistant on mariaDB for some time and want to merge an old HA sqlite3 DB and at the same time keep the data you have in mariadb, this wont work.

💡 Do the migration before switching to mariaDB.
